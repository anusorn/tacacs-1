libpam-tacplus (1.3.9+cl1-1) wheezy; urgency=low
  * Non-maintainer upload
  * libtacplus_map APIs to support local mapping, so that TACACS users do not
    add accounts to /etc/passwd to supply home directory, uid, and gid
  * Added the runtime config capability to include another file, so that
    the tacacs servers are only listed in a single place.  Ship using
    /etc/tacplus_servers as an include file, and use it in the pam sample config
  * Modified debian packaging to create separate libtac and libtacplus-map
    packages.
  * Renamed external libtac functions to all have a tac_ prefix, to avoid
    name collision with other programs (the x*alloc family was an issue, in
    particular).
