libnss_tacplus v2.0.0
Oct 30, 2015

This NSS module has one and only one purpose.  It allows a TACACS+
user to login without any local account on the system, when paired
up with pam_tacplus.  libnss_tacplus is not particularly useful by itself.

As such, all it provides is the getpwnam_r entry point, and uses
the authenticate and accounting functions.

Normal use is to have tacplus as the last lookup method
for "passwd" in /etc/nsswitch.conf, although it will work
in any position:
    passwd: compat tacplus

The plugin asks the TACACS+ server if the user is known, and then
asks for attributes, so it can determine the user's privilege
level.

It makes a new connection to the TACACS+ server each time, because libtac
doesn't have support for persistent connections at this time.

If the username is found, and is also found in the local password
file (via fgetpwent()), the local user passwd structure is returned
(that is, the plugin is basicly a NOP).

If the username is not found, a mapped lookup is performed using the
libtacplus_map.so exported functions. The lookup is done by the one or two
digit privilege level (0 by default) to "tacacs", and looking that name up
in the local password file; that is, privilege level 15 looks for local user
"tacacs15".   If found, the password structure is filled in with the
information for that user, *except* that pw_name is filled in with the
original (login) name.

This code is based in the pam_tacplus plugin, written by
Pawel Krawczyk <pawel.krawczyk@hush.com> and Jeroen Nijhof
<jeroen@jeroennijhof.nl>, as well as others.   It is based
on version pam_tacplus version 1.3.9.  It uses the libtac
as found in pam_tacplus.  A few minor changes have been made,
and libtac is built as a static archive library.

This library requires that the libpam_tacplus headers and shared libraries
be built and installed (my modified version, not the stock version) to
build, and to function.

All are performed using TACACS+ protocol [1], designed by Cisco Systems.
This is remote AAA protocol, supported by most Cisco hardware. 

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Recognized options in the configuration file are the same as the command line
arguments for libpam_tacplus, but not all pam_tacplus options are supported.

Option		Management group        Description
--------------- ----------------------- ----------------------------------
debug           ALL                     output debugging information via
                                        syslog(3); note, that the debugging
                                        is heavy, including passwords!
					
secret=STRING   ALL                     can be specified more than once;
                                        secret key used to encrypt/decrypt
                                        packets sent/received from the server

server=HOSTNAME auth, session           can be specified more than once;
server=IP_ADDR                          adds a TACACS+ server to the servers
                                        list
                                        default is 5 seconds

login=STRING    auth                    TACACS+ authentication service,
                                        this can be "pap", "chap" or "login"
                                        at the moment. Default is pap.

service         account, session        TACACS+ service for authorization
                                        and accounting

protocol        account, session        TACACS+ protocol for authorization
                                        and accounting

The last two items are widely described in TACACS+ draft [1]. They are
required by the server, but it will work if they don't match the real
service authorized :)

See tacplus_nss.conf for an example configuration file.

See the libpam_tacplus README for more information on the tacacs
protocol, server_lists, etc.

On first call, we parse the configuration file (we only try once,
unless it can't be opened, in which case we'll keep trying on 
every call).   We then try to connect to a tacacs server.

After connecting we ask if the user is known (we send an authorization
request to the server).  This function sends an encrypted packet to the
TACACS+ server.  The packet contains username to verify. TACACS+ server
replied with either positive or negative response. If the reponse is
negative, the whole thing is over ;)

If the server responds that the user is valid (no authentication
exchange is done), we parse the returned attributes (if any)
looking for the privilege level (any string starting with "priv",
case independent), and then parse out the privilege level, and
construct the "tacacs##" username.

At this time, we make a new connection to the tacacs server on
every getpwnam_r().   Ideally, that would not be done, but it
appears that the linux tacplus server, at least, closes the
connection at it's end after the exchange, so subsequent requests
get SIGPIPE.


Limitations:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Many of them for now :)

	* only subset of TACACS+ protocol is supported; it's enough for
	  most need, though

This libnss_tacplus plugin has only been compiled and tested on
debian wheezy and jessie at this writing.  The FreeBSD NSS interface
is somewhat different, and will require porting.

This plugin has only been tested with the unmodified linux tacacs+
server so far (using the debian wheezy package)
